I have implemented a reusable API handler in the frontend and developed backend API endpoints to fetch data from Sage 300 tables (APOBS and APVEN). This involved creating new models and DTOs, updating the database context, and modifying the frontend dashboard page to consume these APIs. I also addressed several compilation and runtime errors, including correcting column names and handling decimal date conversions from the database.
